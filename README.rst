Raspberry Pi based automatic tea infuser, controlled with an android app.

Installation and usage
======================

Just drop the `tea.py`_ into your Raspberry Pi and run it with ``python tea.py``. Also, attach a servo to BCM pin 18. Once started, the script will start listening on port 8000. You can change this on line 57 of `tea.py`_.
